        <h2>The project</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of this laboratory is to provide a classification of the <b> soils's surface </b> in different locations of <b>Milan</b>. For this purpose, the territory of Milan has been divided into <b> 4 portions </b>, each of which has been assigned to a different group composed of 3 people, with the exception of a single group of 2 people. Our group dealt with the classification of points belonging to the North-East portion of Milan. A total of 60 points were collected for each group (with the exception of the group with two people who collected a total of 40 points).

            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Locally, the classification of the land was made possible thanks to the help of an application developed by a PhD student from Politecnico di Milano. The application in question is <b> Land Cover Collettor</b>, available for mobile application in Google Play and App Store, and also on the Web at this <a href="https://landcover.como.polimi.it/collector/">link</a>. It is free and open source software. 
            <br>
            The nomenclature of the areas has been performed according to Globe Land 30 (<a href="#about">see this paragraph for additional information</a>). In addition to the classification of the ground cover, we also took pictures, one in the direction of each cardinal points.
            <br>
            <br>
            Following the phase of collection of the points, an analysis and elaboration of them was carried out in order to allow their representation through the support of WebGis. In particular, through the QGIS software, all the collected points were analyzed and processed. Being the project developed in the Milan area, all the points outside of this have been removed. The data can be downloaded in JSON format at this <a href="https://landcover.como.polimi.it/collector/">link</a>, in order to display them in QGIS, they must have been converted into a shapefile format. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Subsequently, with the use of Geoserver (an open source server for sharing geospatial data), all the data necessary for the creation of WebGis have been published, particularly: the collected points, the boundary of the portion of Milan analyzed by our group and the raster of Globe Land 30. The latter will serve for a comparison between our collected data and the official ones. 
            <br>
            <br>
        The OpenLayers library was used to create the webGis. OpenLayers makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source. OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. It is completely free, Open Source JavaScript. </p>

        <a name="about"></a><h2>About Land Cover Maps</h2>
        <p>
            Land Cover (LC) maps are fundamental for a wide range of users and applications such as planning, nature and biodiversity protection, natural resources management, etc...
            They represent a key input to monitor the indicators of the sustainable developments and promote evidence-based policy-making on issues like soil consumption and deforestation.
            <br>
            There are different type of land cover maps, but we will focus on a particular one: Globe Land 30. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Globe Land 30 is part of a Chinese project: in 2010, China launched a GLC mapping project, and finally produced the 30 m GLC data product (<a href="http://www.globallandcover.com/">GlobeLand30</a>) with 10 classes for years 2000 and 2010 within a four year period.

        <a name="Collection"></a><h2>Collection of the points</h2>
        <p>
            Our group has been assigned to region 1 (North-East of Milan) and given the data rapresenting the area of our region and the points to collect. They already presented the reference system that was WGS 1984.
            <br>
            We managed the points by converting the shapefiles in KML (Keyhole Markup Language) format using QGIS and subsequently the points to be sampled were important in google maps.
            <br> 
            Land Cover Collector application was downloaded on our mobiles and after the registration we could see a basemap with the user's actual position and four tabs through which we could:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>insert data</li>
            <li>see our collected points</li>
            <li>visualize all the points including those sampled by other users</li>
            <li>additional informations</li>
        </ul>

        <center><ul id="grid">
            <li><img src="img/Collector1.jpg"/></li>
            <li><img src="img/Collector2.jpg"/></li>
        </ul>
    </center>

    <p>
        Once arrived at the site, for each point the same procedures have been applied: we turned on our mobile's GPS and chose the correct classification among the ten GBL30 classes displayed. A personal accuracy level was needed, particularly you could assign a value from 0% to 100%. Sometimes it was necessary to insert comments, for example when it was not possible to reach the point to be sampled. Lastly we took 4 photos of the field in the North, East, South and West directions. We used a compass to check the cardinal directions.
        <br>
        After submitting we could see our collected points displayed on the personal and everyone's map.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Pros:</b>
        <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The application is intuitive</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>Cons:</b>
        <br>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The classification of green areas was sometimes problematic. In our case there were points in different parks, initially they were classified as Grassland, afterwards they were associated with the Artificial surface class according to GlobeLand30 classification system.</li>
        <li>To update the position to the current one it was necessary to close and reopen the application every time.</li>      
    </ul>

    <a name="Processing"></a><h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
        Following the sampling of the points, the processing phase is followed.
        <br>
        First of all, the JSON file was retrieved, which considers all the Land Collector information from the collected points, this kind of format is in fact a lightweight data-interchange format.
        <br>
        In order to process the data within the GIS environment, the JSON file was converted into Shapefile (format readable in QGIS) with the help of a code written in phyton.
        <br>
        With the help of QGIS all the points not falling within the Milan area have been removed.

    <p>

        Subsequently, the data were published using Geoserver, particularly the shapefile with all the samples, the boundary of our survey area and the Globe Land 30 raster, all with the appropriate symbologies.
        <br>
        The original data reference system has been left: WGS 1984

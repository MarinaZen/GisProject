    <h2>Presentation</h2>
    <p>We are a group of girls at the fist year of Geoinformatic Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. With this website we are going to explain the objectives and goals of the Milan Land Cover's project. To have a complete and clear presentation about the project and the context in which it is inserted, switch on <a href="About.html">THIS PAGE</a>.

      Ciao! My name is Marina and I'm 24 years old. 
      I have a bachelor degree in Environmental Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.
      At the moment I'm enrolled in the master's degree in Geoinformatic Engineering, always at Politecnico di Milano.
      My passions? I love reading fantasy books and mangas, watching TV series and doramas. I also like hiking, snorkelling (but I'm scared by fishes!!) and, of course, travelling around the world!

      My name is Marta Rossi, I'm 23 years old and I'm a student of Politecnico di Milano. I have a bachelor degree in Environmental engineering at Politecnico and I'm now enrolled in Geoinformatics master's degree.
      My passion is doing sports in general, expecially volleyball that I've been playing in my city's team for ten years. In my free time I like visiting new cities or natural places with my family or friends.

   <h2>Naomi Pet</h2>
   <p>
    Shalom! I've done my Bachelor degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in Tel Aviv University, and decided to pursue my passion for environmental topics in the Master program of Geoinformatics at Politecnico di Milano. I'm a passionate problem solver, poor cook and zero waste enthusiast. I like Italian mountains, and try my best to explore as much as possible, but also miss playing beach volley and building sand castles at Tel Aviv.
